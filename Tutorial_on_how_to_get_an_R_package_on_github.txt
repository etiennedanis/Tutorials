### January 25th, 2020 ###
### Based on a quick tutorial given via Zoom by Sean Davis

### This introductory tutorial assumes that you already have git and R installed on your computer.
### It also assumes that you are using a Linux OS and that you are using vim as a text editor.
### This tutorial was validated using bash on Ubuntu 18.04.5.
### NOTE: The commands should work with other Linux OS and Mac, except for
### the software installation commands.

### In the terminal, go to Documents.

$ cd Documents

### Create a directory named 'git'.

$ mkdir git

### Inside the directory 'git', create a new R package.
### Type 'R' to create an R workspace then create a new R package with devtools.

$ R # Just one capital letter 'R' and type enter.
>

### Then you'll need the R package devtools.
### If you do not have devtools installed, install devtools the following way, type:

> install.packages('devtools')

### If you encounter issues with the installation of devtools, in particular with an error
### message about the installation of other required packages such as 'gert' and 'usethis',
### open another command line terminal and install 'libgit2-dev' with the following command:

$ sudo apt-get install libgit2-dev # If you are using Linux

### Once devtools is installed, load the required packages, create a new R package and quit the R workspace.

> library(devtools)
> devtools::create('NewRpackage')
✔ Creating 'NewRpackage/'
✔ Setting active project to '/home/yourusername/Documents/git/NewRpackage'
✔ Creating 'R/'
✔ Writing 'DESCRIPTION'
Package: NewRpackage
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R (parsed):
    * First Last <first.last@example.com> [aut, cre] (<https://orcid.org/YOUR-ORCID-ID>)
Description: What the package does (one paragraph).
License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to
    pick a license
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
RoxygenNote: 7.1.1
✔ Writing 'NAMESPACE'

> quit()

### You should have inside the new R package named 'NewRpackage', three files
### 'DESCRIPTION', 'NAMESPACE' '.Rhistory' and a directory 'R/'

$ cd NewRpackage
$ ls -ah
DESCRIPTION   NAMESPACE   R/   .history

### Now, create a git repository using 'git init'.
### The NewRpackage directory should contain the additional file '.git'

$ git init
$ ls -ah
DESCRIPTION   .git/   NAMESPACE   R/   .history

### You can checked the status of your git repository with 'git status'.
### NOTE: Check the git status often to keep track of all changes.

$ git status
On branch master
No commits yet
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .Rhistory
        DESCRIPTION
        NAMESPACE
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

### Now add the files and folder to be added to the git repository

$ git add DESCRIPTION NAMESPACE R/ # The directory R being empty it will not be added.

### Check the new git status

$ git status
On branch master
No commits yet
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   DESCRIPTION
        new file:   NAMESPACE
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .Rhistory

### Before commiting your documents to your git repository and if it is the fist time
### that you commit documents to a git repository,
### add personal information to your git repository.

$ git config --global user.email "yourEmail@gmail.com"
$ git config --global user.name "First name Last name"

### You can check that your information was correctly recorded with:

$ git config --global user.email
yourEmail@gmail.com

$ git congig --global user.name
Your name

### Then commit your added documents to your local git repository with a message:

$ git commit -m "First commit for this new R package"
[master (root-commit) edbe94e] First commit for this new R package
 2 files changed, 18 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 DESCRIPTION
 create mode 100644 NAMESPACE

### You can add some information in the DESCRIPTION file and commit the new changes.
### The lines you can change are for example the ones for the title, the author or
### the description.

$ vim DESCRIPTION
Package: NewRpackage
Title: This package is just for the tutorial.
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R:
    person(given = "First name",
           family = "Last name",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "yourEmail@gmail.com",
           comment = c(ORCID = "YOUR-ORCID-ID"))
Description: This package does nothing at all.
License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to
    pick a license

LazyData: true
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)

### Save changes in vim and exit it.
### If you check the status of your git repository, it will warn you that changes
### have not been made and need to be added and re-committed.

$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   DESCRIPTION
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .Rhistory
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

### To see what changes were made, use git diff:

$ git diff DESCRIPTION

### Re-add the file DESCRIPTION to the git repository and commit it
### with a new message.

$ git add DESCRIPTION
$ git commit -m 'I just changed the title, the author name and email address'

### You can track the history of the work on the git repository with
### git log

$ git log

### Upload your new R package to github
### Go to your github page https://github.com
### If you don't have one, create one.

### On your page, in the left corner, find and click on 'New'
### to create new repository.

### Type the name of your repository.
### For example, 'NewRpackage'

### Back on your terminal, type:

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/NewRpackage.git
$ git branch -M main
$ git push -u origin main

### You will be asked to give your username and password to access your 
### github account.

### And your new R package should be on github.
### Congratulations!
